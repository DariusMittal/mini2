<h1>The Brown Thrush</h1>
<p>
There's a merry brown thrush sitting up in the tree.<br>
"He's singing to me !He's singing to me!"<br>
</p>
<p>
And what does he say ,little girl,little boy?<br>
"Oh,the world's running over with joy!"<br>
</p>
<p>
Don't you hear?Don't you see?<br>
Hush!Look!in my tree,<br>
</p>
<p>
I'm as happy as happy can be !"<br>
And the brown thrush keeps singing,"A nest do you see,<br>
</p>
<p>
And five eggs,hid by me in the juniper tree?<br>
Don't meddle!Don't touch,little girl,little boy,<br>
</p>
<p>
Or the world will lose some of its joy!<br>
Now I'm glad!Now I'm free!
</p>
<p>
And I always shall be,<br>
If you never bring sorrow to me".
